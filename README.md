# planssi

Planssi is a simple websocket-driven graphics overlay system for OBS

### Heavily work-in-progress

- MySQL is used but not needed at this point. It will be used at later stage to store overlay configurations, users etc.

- Use planssi/planssi1337 for (weak) login

- Graphics are courtesy of Finnish Game Jam ry, only for testing purposes.
